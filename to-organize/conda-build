# If conda doesn't have a package, then you can 
#   build a conda package from a package on pypi
#   (pip installable). 

conda skeleton pypi packagename OR conda skeleton pypi packagename --recursive
conda build packagename
conda install --use-local packagename

# After `conda install --use-local packagename`, you
#   can upload data to anaconda.org / binstar.org.
#   Directions for doing so appear as part of the
#   standard out generated after running `conda install...`
